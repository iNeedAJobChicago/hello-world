# hello-world
I am a student at The University of Illinois at Chicago studying Industrial Engineering. My course work has covered a bit of Statistics, Linear Regresison, Stochastic Processes, linear/non-linear programming, and a bit of python programming. 

I'm interested in Operations Research and Data Analysis. I wish to learn more about machine learning in order to apply it to these fields.
